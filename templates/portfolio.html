				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Currently a Product Designer for enterprise and consumer web applications at Hightail, I am also a graduate of the University of Michigan School of Information. I have a Master of Science in Information with specializations in Human-Computer Interaction and Information Economics.</p>

				<p>I have an enduring fascination with people and their intersection with technology. My current interests include applications related to pervasive (aka ubiquitous) computing and computer-supported cooperative work.</p>

				<p class="emphasis">What I enjoy most is digging deeply into the lives of people and applying my creativity to create elegant solutions.</p>

				<h2>Portfolio</h2>
				<!-- p>Curious about what I can do for you? My experience thus far has ranged from usability testing to contextual inquiry (interviewing, surveys, work analysis, etc.) to experience design, making me a solid researcher. In my free time, I am working on improving practical skills in prototyping and web-design by learning to use tools like the Adobe creative suite, Javascript/HTML/CSS, Flash, and more.</p -->

				<p>Pervasive Interaction and Experience Design (Spring 2011)</p>
				<p>Worked with a team to design and prototype a pervasive (ubicomp) application for the University of Michigan&#8217;s brand-new North Quad Residential complex. Used contextual inquiry and &#8220;speed-dating&#8221; techniques to understand users and the physical environment. The project required us to design for an ecosystem of wall-displays, smartphones, and web-apps. Presented to community directors and developed concept videos (see below for final video). Final prototype featured live QR-codes and semi-responsive adaptive text.</p>
				<p>See <a href="http://si612boop.wordpress.com/">http://si612boop.wordpress.com/</a> for more information, including concept description, research, and more!</p>
